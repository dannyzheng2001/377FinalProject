# Project Name
PokeWiki
# Target Browsers
Our target browsers are Safari for IOS and Google Chrome for other users.
# Description of our Project
For our project, we used the Pokemon API, https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto/
# Visualization
Our project did not have any graph or charts, so we did not use any visualization tools
# Visualization and other JavaScript Libraries
Since we do not display any chars or graphs, we did not use any external JavaScript libraries such as Chart.js and any other visualization tools/frameworks
# CSS framework and version
The default CSS was enough to style our entire website, so we did not use any external framework like Bootstrap.
# Project Display
Our project aims to display Pokemon information visually to the user. The website will include a picture of the pokemon (user will also have the option to display the shiny version of the pokemon, which is the same picture but in different color) and 15 randomly generate movesets for the pokemon. All of these information will be pulled from the API data.
